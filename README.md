### Hi there 👋 I am Antonio but on the ether, I usually got the moniker antoprd /æntoʊ piː ɑr diː/

🧑‍💻 I am a software developer from Italy and I like to learn a lot of things. 
I just discovered that it is plenty of things I don't know and I probably never be able to learn, 
but I try to do my best to explore the huge world of tech and IT.

🔧 If I should describe what I am more confident of, I would choose the .NET ecosystem. I have been working on that for the last 6 years. 
🎯 I have a short-term target of improving my knowledge of the JAVA ecosystem. 
🌱 I also have a long-term objective: dive into the world of AI.
🌐 Have a website on the make. I will post the link when it will be available.
