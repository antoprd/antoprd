### Hello,

My name is Antonio

🧑‍💻 I am a software developer from Italy, and I enjoy learning about a wide range of topics.  
I've recently come to realize that there's plenty I don't know, and some things I may never fully grasp!  
🐌 But I'm committed to doing my best to explore the vast realm of technology and IT.  


🔧 I have been working mainly on backend development with .NET ecosystem for the last 6 years.  

🎯 In the short term, I'm focused on enhancing my knowledge of the JAVA ecosystem.  

🌱 I also have a long-term objective: delving into the field of AI.  

🌐 I'm currently working on my website, and I'll share the link as soon as it becomes available.
